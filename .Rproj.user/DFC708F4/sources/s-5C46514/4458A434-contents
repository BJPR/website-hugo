*Silva Portentosa* comprises texts, translations, and miscellanea by [Brian J. Reilly](http://www.brianjreilly.com) (PhD, French, Yale University).
<p>See the menu at the top right for its main projects:</p>
<ul><li>**Digital Bédier** will provide an interactive text and translation of *La tradition manuscrite du* Lai de l'ombre by Joseph Bédier</li>
<li>**French Studies** will provide statistics about the history of French Studies in the United States of America</li></ul>

<p>Until those projects' sites are ready, their content will be blogged about here first.</p>
