<p>[p. 61] In general, we do not need to fall back on the study of an author’s style to know the order in which they write their works. Most authors took care to indicate themselves the relation of each piece of writing to their previous writings, which allows us to take stock of their progress and the path they followed in arriving at their ultimate conclusions. Nevertheless, Plato handled each of his works with such perfect art and deigned so little to tell us about himself that it is rather difficult to find beginning or end of the admirable circle formed by his dialogues. From this is born the famous problem of Platonic chronology, believed unsolvable by many historians and handled in many contradictory ways by others. As we are dealing not only with an artist but a thinker, it is all the more important to know the order of Plato’s works than that of Shakespeare’s dramas, on which we have spent so much erudition and so many patient studies. We want to give an account of the development of form as well as thought when dealing with a philosopher who was also a great writer. The great difficulty consists in the almost complete absence of testimony [p. 62] about his life and his writings. We know only that the <em>Laws</em> are a work of his late life, according to the testimony of Aristotle,</p>
